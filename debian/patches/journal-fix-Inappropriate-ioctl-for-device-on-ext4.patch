Subject: journal: fix Inappropriate ioctl for device on ext4

Logs constantly show

systemd-journald[395]: Failed to set file attributes: Inappropriate ioctl for device

This is because ext4 does not support FS_NOCOW_FL.

[zj: fold into one conditional as suggested on the ML and
     fix (preexisting) r/errno confusion in error message.]
