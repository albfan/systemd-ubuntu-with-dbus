Subject: systemctl: Don't forward telinit u to upstart

When dist-upgrading and /sbin/init changes from upstart to systemd, upstart's
Restart() exec's argv[0] which is  still /sbin/init, and thus it execs systemd.
This is triggered by glibc upgrades or other things which call "telinit u" in
their postinst scripts.

This should eventually be fixed in upstart itself, but as we can't
retroactively fix it in previous releases we upgrade from, we simply ignore
the request.
