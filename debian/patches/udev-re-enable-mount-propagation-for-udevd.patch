Subject: udev: re-enable mount propagation for udevd

laptop-mode-tools remounts file systems from within a udev rule to apply
certain mount options. With MountFlags=slave, those mounts then become private
to the systemd-udevd namespace and are no longer accessible from outside the
namespace.
While the root cause is the broken behaviour of laptop-mode-tools, with mount
propagation turned off, this can result in a read-only root file system.
Therefore revert the relevant parts from commit
c2c13f2df42e0691aecabe3979ea81cd7faa35c7 to re-enable mount propagation for
udevd.

Once affected packages have been fixed, this patch should be dropped
again.

Closes: #762018
