systemd (219-5ubuntu1) vivid; urgency=medium

  * Merge with Debian experimental branch. Remaining Ubuntu changes:
    - Hack to support system-image read-only /etc, and modify files in
      /etc/writable/ instead.
    - Keep our much simpler udev maintainer scripts (all platforms must
      support udev, no debconf).
    - initramfs init-top: Drop $ROOTDELAY, we do that in a more sensible way
      with wait-for-root. Will get applicable to Debian once Debian gets
      wait-for-root in initramfs-tools.
    - initramfs init-bottom: If LVM is installed, settle udev,
      otherwise we get missing LV symlinks. Workaround for LP #1185394.
    - Add debian/udev.lvm2.init: Dummy SysV init script to satisfy insserv
      dependencies to "lvm2" which is handled with udev rules in Ubuntu.
    - Provide shutdown fallback for upstart. (LP: #1370329)
    - debian/extra/ifup@.service: Additionally run for "auto" class. We don't
      really support "allow-hotplug" in Ubuntu at the moment, so we need to
      deal with "auto" devices appearing after "/etc/init.d/networking start"
      already ran. (LP: #1374521) Also, check if devices are actually defined
      in /etc/network/interfaces as we don't use Debian's net.agent.
    - ifup@.service: Drop dependency on networking.service (i. e.
      /etc/init.d/networking), and merely ensure that /run/network exists.
      This avoids unnecessary dependencies/waiting during boot and dependency
      cycles if hooks wait for other interfaces to come up (like ifenslave
      with bonding interfaces). (LP: #1414544)
    - Add Get-RTC-is-in-local-time-setting-from-etc-default-rc.patch: In
      Ubuntu we currently keep the setting whether the RTC is in local or UTC
      time in /etc/default/rcS "UTC=yes|no", instead of /etc/adjtime.
      (LP: #1377258)
    - Put session scopes into all cgroup controllers. This makes unprivileged
      user LXC containers work under systemd. (LP: #1346734)
    - systemctl: Don't forward telinit u to upstart. This works around
      upstart's Restart() always reexec'ing /sbin/init on Restart(), even if
      that changes to point to systemd during the upgrade. This avoids running
      systemd during a dist-upgrade. (LP: #1430479)
    - Lower Breaks: to plymouth version which has the udev inotify fix in
      Ubuntu.
    - Lower libappamor1 dep to the Ubuntu version where it moved to /lib.
    - Change systemd-sysv's conflicts to upstart-sysv. (LP: #1422681)
    - Make failure of boot-and-services NSpawn.test_boot non-fatal for now.
      This currently fails when being triggered by Jenkins, but is totally
      unreproducible when running this manually on the exact same machine.

    Upgrade fixes, keep until 16.04 LTS release:
    - systemd Conflicts/Replaces/Provides systemd-services.
    - Remove obsolete systemd-logind upstart job.
    - Clean up obsolete /etc/udev/rules.d/README.

  [ Didier Roche ]
  * Add "systemd-fsckd" autopkgtest. (LP: #1427312)
  * cmdline-upstart-boot autopkgtest: Update to Ubuntu's upstart-sysv split
    (test gets skipped on Debian while upstart-sysv does not yet exist there).
  * Cherry-pick a couple of upstream commits for adding transient state,
    fixing a race where mounts become available before the device being
    available.
  * Ensure PrivateTmp doesn't require tmpfs through tmp.mount, but rather adds
    an After relationship. (Closes: #779902)

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * journald: Suppress expected cases of "Failed to set file attributes"
    errors. (LP: #1427899)
  * Add systemd-sysv.postinst: Update grub on first installation, so that the
    alternative init system boot entries get updated.
  * debian/tests: Call /tmp/autopkgtest-reboot, to work with autopkgtest >=
    3.11.1.
  * Check for correct architecture identifiers for SuperH. (Closes: #779710)
  * Fix tmpfiles.d to only apply the first match again (regression in 219).
    (LP: #1428540)

  * tmpfiles: Avoid creating duplicate ACL entries. Add postinst code to clean
    them up on upgrade. (Closes: #778656)
  * bootchart: Fix path to default init. (LP: #1423867)
  * Add "bootchart" autopkgtest, to spot regressions like the above.
  * autopkgtests: Factorize out "assert.sh" utility functions, and use them in
    the tests for useful failure messages.
  * Downgrade requirement for timedated, hostnamed, localed-locale, and
    logind autopkgtests from machine to container isolation.
  * boot-and-services and display-manager autopkgtest: Add systemd-sysv as
    proper test dependency instead of apt-get installing it. This works now
    also under Ubuntu 15.04.
  * boot-and-services autopkgtest: Check cleanup of temporary files during
    boot. Reproduces #779169.
  * Clean up /tmp/ directory again. (Closes: #779169, LP: #1424992)

systemd (219-3) experimental; urgency=medium

  * sysv-generator: fix wrong "Overwriting existing symlink" warnings.
    (Closes: #778700)
  * Add systemd-fsckd multiplexer and feed its output to plymouth. This
    provides an aggregate progress report of running file system checks and
    also allows cancelling them with ^C, in both text mode and Plymouth.
    (Closes: #775093, #758902; LP: #1316796)
  * Revert "journald: allow restarting journald without losing stream
    connections". This was a new feature in 219, but currently causes boot
    failures due to logind and other services not starting up properly.
    (Closes: #778970; LP: #1423811)
  * Add "boot-smoke" autopkgtest: Test 20 successful reboots in a row, and
    that there are no connection timeouts or stalled jobs. This reproduces the
    above regression.
  * debian/tests/localed-locale: Set up locale and keyboard default files on a
    minimal unconfigured testbed.
  * Add missing python3 test dependency to cmdline-upstart-boot and
    display-managers autopkgtests.
  * debian/tests/boot-and-services: Skip AppArmor test if AppArmor is not
    enabled.
  * debian/tests/boot-and-services: Reboot also if lightdm was just installed
    but isn't running yet.

  * Fix UTF-16 to UTF-8 conversion on big-endian machines. (Closes: #778654)
  * Disable new new test-sigbus, it fails on some buildds due to too old
    kernels. (part of #778654)
  * debian/README.Debian, debian/systemd.postinst: Drop setfacl call for
    /var/log/journal, this is now done automatically by tmpfiles.d/systemd.conf.
  * Drop "acl" dependency, not necessary any more with the above.
  * debian/tests/boot-and-services: Move to using /var/lib/machines/,
    /var/lib/containers is deprecated.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * New upstream release:
    - Fix spelling mistake in systemd.unit(5). (Closes: #773302)
    - Fix timeouts with D-Bus, leading to SIGFPE. (Closes: #774012)
    - Fix load/save of multiple rfkill states. (Closes: #759489)
    - Non-persistant journal (/run/log/journal) is now readable by group adm.
      (Closes: #771980)
    - Read netdev user mount option to correctly order network mounts after
      network.target. (Closes: #769186)

      (Closes: #757367)
    - Fix ThinkPad X1 Carbon 20BT trackpad buttons (LP: #1414930)
    - Drop all backported patches and port the others to new upstream release.
  * Bump libblkid-dev build dependency as per upstream configure.ac.
  * debian/systemd.install: Add new language-fallback-map file.
  * debian/udev.install: Add new systemd-hwdb tool.
  * debian/libsystemd0.symbols: Add new symbols from this release.
  * tmpfiles.d/systemd.conf: Drop "wheel" ACL (that group does not exist in
    Debian) to make the ACL for "adm" actually work.
  * debian/rules: Explicitly disable importd for now; it should still mature a
    bit. Explicitly enable hwdb support.
  * /lib/lsb/init-functions.d/40-systemd: Call systemctl is-system-running
    with --quiet. (LP: #1421058)
  * debian/systemd.postrm: Clean getty@tty1.service and remote-fs.target
    enablement symlinks on purge. (Closes: #778499)
  * Move all Debian specific units in the systemd package into
    debian/extra/units/ and simplify debian/systemd.install.
  * Enable timesyncd by default. Add a config drop-in to not start if ntp,
    openntpd, or chrony is installed. (Closes: #755722)
  * debian/systemd.links: Drop obsolete hwclockfirst.service mask link, this
    was dropped in wheezy's util-linux already.
  * debian/udev.postinst: Call systemd-hwdb instead of udevadm hwdb.

  * Pull latest keymaps from upstream git. (LP: #1334968, #1409721)
  * rules: Fix by-path of mmc RPMB partitions and don't blkid them. Avoids
    kernel buffer I/O errors and timeouts. (LP: #1333140)
  * Clean up stale mounts when ejecting CD drives with the hardware eject
    button. (LP: #1168742)
  * Document systemctl --failed option. (Closes: #767267)
  * Quiesce confusing and irrelevant "failed to reset devices.list" warning.
    (LP: #1413193)
  * When booting with systemd-bootchart, default to run systemd rather than
    /sbin/init (which might not be systemd). (LP: #1417059)
  * boot-and-services autopkgtest: Add CgroupsTest to check cgroup
    creation/cleanup behaviour. This reproduces #777601 and verifies the fix
    for it.

systemd (218-9) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/tests/logind: With dropped systemd-logind-launch we don't have a
    visible /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd/ any more under cgmanager. So adjust the
    test to check /proc/self/cgroup instead.
  * Add unit-config autopkgtest to check systemd unit/sysv init enabling and
    disabling via systemctl. This also reproduces #777613.
  * systemctl: Always install/enable/disable native units, even if there is a
    corresponding SysV script and we call update-rc.d; while the latter
    handles WantedBy=, it does not handle Alias=. (Closes: #777613)
  * cgroup: Don't trim cgroup trees created by someone else, just the ones
    that systemd itself created. This avoids cleaning up empty cgroups from
    e.g. LXC. (Closes: #777601)
  * Don't parse /etc/mtab for current mounts, but /proc/self/mountinfo. If the
    former is a file, it's most likely outdated on boot, leading to race
    conditions and unmounts during boot. (LP: #1419623)

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Explicitly disable the features we don't want to build for those with
    autodetection. This ensures reliable build results in dirty build
    environments.
  * Disable AppArmor support in the udeb build.
  * core: Don't fail to run services in --user instances if $HOME is missing.
    (Closes: #759320)

  [ Didier Roche ]
  * default-display-manager-generator: Avoid unnecessary /dev/null symlink and
    warning if there is no display-manager.service unit.

systemd (218-8) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * boot-and-services autopkgtest: Ensure that there are no failed units,
    except possibly systemd-modules-load.service (as that notoriously fails
    with cruft in /etc/modules).
  * Revert "input" system group creation in systemd.postinst from 218-7. It's
    already done in udev.postinst.
  * ifup@.service: Revert checking for existance of ifupdown config for that
    interface, net.agent already does that.
  * Drop Also-redirect-to-update-rc.d-when-not-using-.service.patch; not
    necessary any more with the current version (mangle_names() already takes
    care of this).
  * Merge into Add-support-for-rcS.d-init-scripts-to-the-sysv-gener.patch:
    - Do-not-order-rcS.d-services-after-local-fs.target-if.patch, as it
      partially reverts the above, and is just fixing it.
    - Map-rcS.d-init-script-dependencies-to-their-systemd-.patch as it's just
      adding some missing functionality for the same purpose.
  * Merge Run-update-rc.d-defaults-before-update-rc.d-enable-d.patch into
    Make-systemctl-enable-disable-call-update-rc.d-for-s.patch as the former
    is fixing the latter and is not an independent change.
  * Drop Launch-logind-via-a-shell-wrapper.patch and systemd-logind-launch
    wrapper. The only remaining thing that we need from it is to create
    /run/systemd/, move that into the D-BUS service file directly.
  * /lib/lsb/init-functions.d/40-systemd: Avoid deadlocks during bootup and
    shutdown. DHCP/ifupdown and similar hooks which call "/etc/init.d/foo
    reload" can easily cause deadlocks, since the synchronous wait plus
    systemd's normal behaviour of transactionally processing all dependencies
    first easily causes dependency loops. Thus during boot/shutdown operate
    only on the unit and not on its dependencies, just like SysV behaves.
    (Closes: #777115, LP: #1417010)
  * Only start logind if dbus is installed. This fixes the noisy startup
    failure in environments without dbus, such as LXC containers or servers.
    (part of #772700)
  * Add getty-static.service unit which starts getty@.service on tty 2 to 6 if
    dbus is not installed, and hence logind cannot auto-start them on demand.
    (Closes: #772700)

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Update insserv-generator and map $x-display-manager to
    display-manager.service, following the recent change in sysv-generator.
    This avoids creating references to a no longer existing
    x-display-manager.target unit.

  * logind: handle closing sessions over daemon restarts. (Closes: #759515,
    LP: #1415104)
  * logind: Fix sd_eviocrevoke ioctl call, to make forced input device release
    after log out actually work.
  * debian/rules: Drop obsolete --disable-multi-seat-x and
    --with-firmware-path configure options.
  * debian/udev.README.Debian: Trim the parts which are obsolete, wrong, or
    described in manpages. Only keep the Debian specific bits.
    (Part of #776546)
  * Actually install udev's README.Debian when building for Debian.
    (Closes: #776546)
  * Create system group "input" which was introduced in 215. (LP: #1414409)
  * ifup@.service: Don't fail if the interface is not configured in
    /etc/network/interfaces at all. (LP: #1414426)

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Update Vcs-Browser URL to use cgit and https.
  * Map $x-display-manager LSB facility to display-manager.service instead of
    making it a target. Using a target had the downside that multiple display
    managers could hook into it at the same time which could lead to several
    failed start attempts for the non-default display manager.

    apply when building on/for Ubuntu:
    - Add 40-hyperv-hotadd.rules: Workaround for LP: #1233466.
    - Add 61-persistant-storage-android.rules to create persistent symlinks
      for partitions with PARTNAME. By Ricardo Salveti.
    - Add 71-power-switch-proliant.rules for supporting the power switches of
      ProLiant Server Cartridges. By Dann Frazier.
    - Add 78-graphics-card.rules: Mark KMS capable graphics devices as
      PRIMARY_DEVICE_FOR_DISPLAY so that we can wait for those in plymouth.
      By Scott James Remnant.
    - Don't install the Debian *.agent scripts. Instead, have Ubuntu's
      80-networking.rules directly pull in ifup@.service, which is much easier
      and more efficient.
  * Make EPERM/EACCESS when applying OOM adjustment for forked processes
    non-fatal. This happens in user namespaces like unprivileged LXC
    containers.
  * Fix assertion failure due to /dev/urandom being unmounted when shutting
    down unprivileged containers. Thanks Stéphane Graber.
  * Enable EFI support. This mostly auto-mounts /sys/firmware/efi/efivars, but
    also provides a generator for auto-detecting the root and the /boot/efi
    partition if they aren't in /etc/fstab. (Closes: #773533)

    might not get into Jessie any more. (Closes: #742048)

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * fstab-generator: Handle mountall's non-standard "nobootwait" and
    "optional" options. ("bootwait" is already the systemd default behaviour,
    and "showthrough" is irrelevant here, so both can be ignored).
  * Add autopkgtest for one-time boot with upstart when systemd-sysv is
    installed. This test only works under Ubuntu which has a split out
    upstart-bin package, and will be skipped under Debian.
  * debian/ifup@.service: Check if ifup succeeds by calling ifquery, to
    work around ifup not failing on invalid interfaces (see #773539)
  * debian/ifup@.service: Set proper service type (oneshot).
  * sysv-generator: Handle .sh suffixes when translating Provides:.

  [ Christian Kastner ]
  * Use common-session-noninteractive in systemd-user's PAM config, instead of
    common-session. The latter can include PAM modules like libpam-mount which
    expect to be called just once and/or interactively, which already happens
    for login, ssh, or the display-manager. Add pam_systemd.so explicitly, as
    it's not included in -noninteractive, but is always required (and
    idempotent). There is no net change on systemd which don't use manually
    installed PAM modules. (Closes: #739676)

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * New upstream release. (Closes: #729566)
  * Update patches.
  * Update symbols files for libsystemd-journal and libsystemd-login.
  * Install new files and remove the ones we don't use.
  * Install zsh completion files. (Closes: #717540)
  * Create a compat symlink /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf as systemd-sysctl no
    longer reads /etc/sysctl.conf.
  * Bump Build-Depends on kmod to (>= 14).
  * Bump Build-Depends on libcryptsetup-dev to (>= 2:1.6.0) for tcrypt
    support.
  * Make kmod-static-nodes.service check for the kmod binary since we don't
    want a hard dependency on kmod e.g. for container installations.
  * Disable various features which aren't required for the udeb build.
  * Move new sd_pid_get_slice and sd_session_get_vt man pages into
    libsystemd-login-dev.
  * Make no-patch-numbers the default for gbp-pq.
  * Adjust systemd-user pam config file for Debian.
    This pam config file is used by libpam-systemd/systemd-logind when
    launching systemd user instances.
  * Drop patches to make logind D-Bus activatable. The cgroup handling has
    been reworked in v205 and logind no longer creates cgroup hierarchies on
    its own. That means that the standalone logind is no longer functional
    without support from systemd (or an equivalent cgroup manager).

systemd (204-13) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Switch back to load the sg module via the kmod builtin. The problem was
    not that the kmod builtin is faster then modprobe but rather the incorrect
    usage of the "=" assignment operator. We need to use "+=" here, so the sg
    module is loaded in addition to other scsi modules, which are loaded via
    the modalias rule. Thanks to Tommaso Colombo for the analysis.
  * Cherry-pick upstream fix which prevents systemd from entering an infinite
    loop when trying to break an ordering cycle. (Closes: #752259)
  * Update insserv generator to not create any drop-in files for services
    where the corresponding SysV init script does not exist.
  * Drop the check for /sys/kernel/uevent_helper from postinst and the SysV
    init script and do not unconditionally overwrite it in the initramfs hook.
    Since a long time now udev has been using the netlink interface to
    communicate with the kernel and with Linux 3.16 it is possible to disable
    CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER completely. (Closes: #752742)

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Change the sg loading rule (for Debian #657948) back to using modprobe.
    kmod is too fast and then sg races with sd, causing the latter to not see
    SCSI disks.  (Closes: #752591, #752605)

  * Explain patch management in debian/README.source. (Closes: #739113)
  * Replace "Always probe cpu support drivers" patch with cherry-picked
    upstream fix which is more general.
  * Advertise hibernation only if there's enough free swap. Patches backported
    from current upstream. (LP: #1313522)
  * Fix typo in sg loading rule to make it actually work.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Make no-patch-numbers the default for gbp-pq.
  * Cherry-pick upstream fix to properly handle multiline syslog messages.
    (Closes: #746351)
  * Cherry-pick upstream fix for libudev which fixes a memleak in
    parent_add_child().
  * Drop "-b debian" from Vcs-Git since we use the master branch for
    packaging now.
  * Drop Conflicts: sysvinit (<< 2.88dsf-44~) from systemd-sysv since this
    breaks dist-upgrades from wheezy when switching from sysvinit to
    systemd-sysv as default init. While downgrading the Pre-Depends in
    sysvinit would have been an alternative, dropping the Conflicts and only
    keeping the Replaces was deemed the lesser evil. (Closes: #748355)
  * Use Conflicts instead of Breaks against sysvinit-core. This avoids
    /sbin/init going missing when switching from systemd-sysv to sysvinit.
    While at it, add a Replaces: upstart. (Closes: #751589)
  * Make the SysV compat tools try both /run/initctl and /dev/initctl. This
    makes them usable under sysvinit as PID 1 without requiring any symlinks.
  * Various ifupdown integration fixes
    - Use DefaultDependencies=no in ifup@.service so the service can be
      started as early as possible.
    - Create the ifupdown runtime directory in ifup@.service as we can no
      longer rely on the networking service to do that for us.
    - Don't stop ifup@.service on shutdown but let the networking service take
      care of stopping all hotplugged interfaces.
    - Only start ifup@.service for interfaces configured as allow-hotplug.

  * On Dell PowerEdge systems, the iDRAC7 and later support a USB Virtual NIC
    for management. Name this interface "idrac" to avoid confusion with "real"
    network interfaces.
  * Drop numerical prefixes from patches, to avoid future diff noise when

  * The "Flemish Beef and Beer Stew" release.

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Do proper refcounting of the PAM module package on prerm, so that we
    don't drop the module from the PAM config when uninstalling a
    foreign-arch package.  Related to Ubuntu bug #1295521.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/udev.udev-finish.upstart: Fix path to tmp-rules,
    debian/extra/rule_generator.functions creates them in /run/udev/.
  * rules: Remove the kernel-install bits; we don't want that in Debian and
    thus it shouldn't appear in dh_install --list-missing output.
  * Ship sd-shutdown.h in libsystemd-daemon-dev.
  * Run dh_install with --fail-missing, to avoid forgetting files when we move
    to new versions.
  * Mount /dev/pts with the correct permissions in the udev, to avoid needing
    pt_chown (not available on all architectures). Thanks Adam Conrad.
  * Add new block of Windows Azure ethernet hardware address to
    75-persistent-net-generator.rules. (LP: #1274348, Closes: #739018)
  * Drop our Debian specific 60-persistent-storage{,-tape}.rules and use the
    upstream rules. They are compatible and do a superset of the
    functionality. (Closes: #645466)
  * Drop our Debian specific 80-drivers.rules and use the upstream rules with
    a patch for the sg module (see #657948). These now stop calling modprobe
    and use the kmod builtin, giving some nice boot speed improvement.
    (Closes: #717404)
  * Drop our Debian specific 50-udev-default.rules and 91-permissions.rules
    and use the upstream rules with a patch for the remaining Debian specific
    default device permissions. Many thanks to Marco d'Itri for researching
    which Debian-specific rules are obsolete! Amongst other things, this now
    also reads the hwdb info for USB devices (Closes: #717405) and gets rid of
    some syntax errors (Closes: #706221)
  * Set default polling interval on removable devices as well, for kernels
    which have "block" built in instead of being a module. (Closes: #713877)
  * Make sd_login_monitor_new() work for logind without systemd.
  * Cherry-pick upstream fix for polkit permissions for rebooting with
    multiple sessions.
  * Kill /etc/udev/links.conf, create_static_nodes, and associated code. It's
    obsolete with devtmpfs (which is required now), and doesn't run with
    systemd or upstart anyway.
  * Drop unnecessary udev.dirs.
  * Add autopkgtests for smoke-testing logind, hostnamed, timedated, localed,
    and a compile/link/run test against libsystemd-login-dev.

  [ Marco d'Itri ]
  * preinst: check for all the system calls required by modern releases
    of udev. (Closes: #648325)
  * Updated fbdev-blacklist.conf for recent kernels.
  * Do not blacklist viafb because it is required on the OLPC XO-1.5.
    (Closes: #705792)
  * Remove write_cd_rules and the associated rules which create "persistent"
    symlinks for CD/DVD devices and replace them with more rules in
    60-cdrom_id, which will create symlinks for one at random among the
    devices installed. Since the common case is having a single device
    then everything will work out just fine most of the times...
    (Closes: #655924)
  * Fix write_net_rules for systemd and sysvinit users by copying the
    temporary rules from /run/udev/ to /etc/udev/. (Closes: #735563)
  * Do not install sysctl.d/50-default.conf because the systemd package
    should not change kernel policies, at least until it will become
    the only supported init system.

  [ Michael Stapelberg ]
  * Add systemd-dbg package, thanks Daniel Schaal (Closes: #742724).
  * Switch from gitpkg to git-buildpackage. Update README.source accordingly.
  * Make libpam-systemd depend on systemd-sysv | systemd-shim. Packages that
    need logind functionality should depend on libpam-systemd.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Do not send potentially private fstab information without prior user
    confirmation. (Closes: #743158)
  * Add support for LSB facilities defined by insserv.
    Parse /etc/insserv.conf.d content and /etc/insserv.conf and generate
    systemd unit drop-in files to add corresponding dependencies. Also ship
    targets for the Debian specific $x-display-manager and
    $mail-transport-agent system facilities. (Closes: #690892)

  * Add preinst check to abort udev upgrade if the currently running kernel
    lacks devtmpfs support. Since udev 176, devtmpfs is mandatory as udev no
    longer creates any device nodes itself. This only affects self-compiled
    kernels which now need CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y.  Closes: #722580
  * Fix SysV init script to correctly mount a devtmpfs instead of tmpfs. This
    only affects users without an initramfs, which usually is responsible for
    mounting the devtmpfs.  Closes: #722604
  * Drop pre-squeeze upgrade code from maintainer scripts and simplify the
    various upgrade checks.
  * Suppress errors about unknown hwdb builtin. udev 196 introduced a new
    "hwdb" builtin which is not understood by the old udev daemon.
  * Add missing udeb line to shlibs.local. This ensures that udev-udeb gets a

      As a result, the udev binary packages will now be built from the systemd
      source package. To align the version numbers 139 releases were skipped.
    - For a complete list of changes, please refer to the NEWS file.
  * Add Marco to Uploaders.
  * Drop Suggests on the various python packages from systemd. The
    systemd-analyze tool has been reimplemented in C.
  * Add binary packages as found in the udev 175-7.2 source package.
  * Wrap dependencies for better readability.
  * Drop hard-coded Depends on libglib2.0-0 from gir1.2-gudev-1.0.
  * Drop old Conflicts, Replaces and Breaks, which are no longer necessary.
  * Make libgudev-1.0-dev depend on gir1.2-gudev-1.0 as per GObject
    introspection mini-policy.  Closes: #691313
  * The hwdb builtin has replaced pci-db and usb-db in udev. Drop the
    Recommends on pciutils and usbutils accordingly.
  * Drop our faketime hack. Upstream uses a custom xsl style sheet now to
    generate the man pages which no longer embeds the build date.
  * Add Depends on libpam-runtime (>= 1.0.1-6) to libpam-systemd as we are
    using pam-auth-update.
  * Explicitly set Section and Priority for the udev binary package.
  * Update Build-Depends:
    - Drop libudev-dev, no longer required.
    - Add gtk-doc-tools and libglib2.0-doc for the API documentation in
      libudev and libgudev.
    - Add libgirepository1.0-dev and gobject-introspection for GObject
      introspection support in libgudev.
    - Add libgcrypt11-dev for encryption support in the journal.
    - Add libblkid-dev for the blkid udev builtin.
  * Use gir dh addon to ensure ${gir:Depends} is properly set.
  * Rename libudev0 → libudev1 for the SONAME bump.
  * Update symbols files. libudev now uses symbols versioning as the other
    libsystemd libraries. The libgudev-1.0-0 symbols file has been copied from
    the old udev package.
  * Run gtkdocize on autoreconf.
  * Enable python bindings for the systemd libraries and ship them in a new
    package named python-systemd.
  * Tighten Depends on libsystemd-id128-dev for libsystemd-journal-dev as per
    libsystemd-journal.pc.
  * Remove obsolete bash-completion scripts on upgrades. Nowadays they are
    installed in /usr/share/bash-completion/completions.
  * Rename conffiles for logind and journald.
  * Rename udev-gtk-udeb → libudev1-udeb to better reflect its actual contents.
  * Build two flavours: a regular build and one for the udev udebs with
    reduced features/dependencies.
  * Create a few compat symlinks for the udev package, most notably
    /sbin/udevadm and /sbin/udevd.
