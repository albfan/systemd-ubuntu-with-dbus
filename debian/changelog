systemd (36-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * New upstream release. Closes: #634618
    - Various man page fixes. Closes: #623521
  * Add debian-fixup service that symlinks mtab to /proc/mounts and
    migrates /var/run and /var/lock to symlinks to /run

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Build for libnotify 0.7.
  * Bump Build-Depends on libudev to (>= 172).
  * Add Build-Depends on libacl1-dev. Required for building systemd-logind
    with ACL support.
  * Split libsystemd-login and libsystemd-daemon into separate binary
    packages.
  * As autoreconf doesn't like intltool, override dh_autoreconf and call
    intltoolize and autoreconf ourselves.
  * Add Build-Depends on intltool.
  * Do a one-time migration of the hwclock configuration. If UTC is set to
    "no" in /etc/default/rcS, create /etc/adjtime and add the "LOCAL" setting.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * hwclock-load.service is no longer installed, so we don't need to remove it

  * Install /usr/lib directory for binfmt.d, modules-load.d, tmpfiles.d and
    sysctl.d.
  * Remove obsolete conffiles from /etc/tmpfiles.d on upgrades. Those files
    are installed in /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d now.
  * Depend on util-linux (>= 2.19.1-2) which provides whole-disk locking
    support in fsck and remove our revert patch.
  * Don't choke when systemd was compiled with a different CAP_LAST_CAP then
    what it is run with. Patch cherry-picked from upstream Git.
    Closes: #628081
  * Enable dev-hugepages.automount and dev-mqueue.automount only when enabled
    in kernel. Patch cherry-picked from upstream Git.  Closes: #624522

  * Depend on initscripts >= 2.88dsf-13.4 for /run transition.

systemd (19-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Add systemd-tmpfiles to systemd package.
  * Add ifup@.service for handling hotplugged interfaces from
    udev.  Closes: #610871
  * Mask mtab.service and udev-mtab.service as they are pointless when
    /etc/mtab is a symlink to /proc/mounts
  * Add breaks on lvm2 (<< 2.02.84-1) since older versions have udev rules
    that don't work well with systemd causing delays on bootup.

systemd (16-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * New upstream release.  Closes: #609611
  * Get rid of now obsolete patches that are upstream.

systemd (15-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * New upstream version, thanks a lot to Michael Biebl for help with
    preparing this version.
    - This version handles cycle breaking better.  Closes: #609225
  * Add libaudit-dev to build-depends
  * /usr/share/systemd/session has been renamed to /usr/share/systemd/user
    upstream, adjust build system accordingly.
  * Remove -s from getty serial console invocation.
  * Add dependency on new util-linux to make sure /sbin/agetty exists
  * Don't mount /var/lock with gid=lock (Debian has no such group).
  * Document problem with ifupdown's /etc/network/run being a normal
    directory.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Revert upstream change which requires libnotify 0.7 (not yet available in
    Debian).
  * Use dh-autoreconf for updating the build system.
  * Revert upstream commit which uses fsck -l (needs a newer version of
    util-linux).
  * Explicitly disable cryptsetup support to not accidentally pick up a
    libcryptsetup dependency in a tainted build environment, as the library
    is currently installed in /usr/lib.
  * Remove autogenerated man pages and vala C sources, so they are rebuilt.
  * Use native systemd mount support:
    - Use MountAuto=yes and SwapAuto=yes (default) in system.conf
    - Mask SysV init mount, check and cleanup scripts.
    - Create an alias (symlink) for checkroot (→ remount-rootfs.service) as
      synchronization point for SysV init scripts.
  * Mask x11-common, rmnologin, hostname, bootmisc and bootlogd.
  * Create an alias for procps (→ systemd-sysctl.service) and
    urandom (→ systemd-random-seed-load.service).
  * Create an alias for module-init-tools (→ systemd-modules-load.service) and
    a symlink from /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf → /etc/modules.
  * Install lsb-base hook which redirects calls to SysV init scripts to
    systemctl: /etc/init.d/<foo> <action> → systemctl <action> <foo.service>
  * Install a (auto)mount unit to mount /lib/init/rw early during boot.
