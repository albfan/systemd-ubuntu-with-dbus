systemd (16-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * New upstream release.  Closes: #609611
  * Get rid of now obsolete patches that are upstream.
  * Use the built-in cryptsetup support in systemd, build-depend on
    libcryptsetup-dev (>= 2:1.2.0-1) to get a libcryptsetup in /lib.
  * Don't use systemctl redirect for init scripts with X-Interactive: true

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Update package description
  * Use v8 debhelper syntax
  * Make single-user mode work
  * Run hwclock-save.service on shutdown
  * Remove dependencies on legacy sysv mount scripts, as we use native
    mounting.

systemd (15-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * New upstream version, thanks a lot to Michael Biebl for help with
    preparing this version.
    - This version handles cycle breaking better.  Closes: #609225
  * Add libaudit-dev to build-depends
  * /usr/share/systemd/session has been renamed to /usr/share/systemd/user
    upstream, adjust build system accordingly.
  * Remove -s from getty serial console invocation.
  * Add dependency on new util-linux to make sure /sbin/agetty exists
  * Don't mount /var/lock with gid=lock (Debian has no such group).
  * Document problem with ifupdown's /etc/network/run being a normal
    directory.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Revert upstream change which requires libnotify 0.7 (not yet available in
    Debian).
  * Use dh-autoreconf for updating the build system.
  * Revert upstream commit which uses fsck -l (needs a newer version of
    util-linux).
  * Explicitly disable cryptsetup support to not accidentally pick up a
    libcryptsetup dependency in a tainted build environment, as the library
    is currently installed in /usr/lib.
  * Remove autogenerated man pages and vala C sources, so they are rebuilt.
  * Use native systemd mount support:
    - Use MountAuto=yes and SwapAuto=yes (default) in system.conf
    - Mask SysV init mount, check and cleanup scripts.
    - Create an alias (symlink) for checkroot (→ remount-rootfs.service) as
      synchronization point for SysV init scripts.
  * Mask x11-common, rmnologin, hostname, bootmisc and bootlogd.
  * Create an alias for procps (→ systemd-sysctl.service) and
    urandom (→ systemd-random-seed-load.service).
  * Create an alias for module-init-tools (→ systemd-modules-load.service) and
    a symlink from /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf → /etc/modules.
  * Install lsb-base hook which redirects calls to SysV init scripts to
    systemctl: /etc/init.d/<foo> <action> → systemctl <action> <foo.service>
  * Install a (auto)mount unit to mount /lib/init/rw early during boot.

systemd (11-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Tighten depends from systemd-* on systemd to ensure they're upgraded
    in lockstep.  Thanks to Michael Biebl for the patch.
  * Add missing #DEBHELPER# token to libpam-systemd
  * Stop messing with runlevel5/multi-user.target symlink, this is handled
    correctly upstream.
  * Stop shipping /cgroup in the package.
  * Remove tmpwatch services, Debian doesn't have or use tmpwatch.
  * Make sure to enable GTK bits.
  * Ship password agent
  * Clean up cgroups properly on upgrades, thanks to Michael Biebl for the
    patch.  Closes: #599577
