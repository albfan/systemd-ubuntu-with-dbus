Description: system and service manager
 systemd is a system and service manager for Linux. It provides aggressive
 parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting
 services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes
 using Linux control groups, supports snapshotting and restoring of the system
 state, maintains mount and automount points and implements an elaborate
 transactional dependency-based service control logic.
 .
 systemd is compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts and can work as a
 drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
 .
 Installing the systemd package will not switch your init system unless you
 boot with init=/bin/systemd or install systemd-sysv in addition.

 .
 This package provides the manual pages and links needed for systemd
 to replace sysvinit. Installing systemd-sysv will overwrite /sbin/init with a
 link to systemd.

 This package contains the PAM module which registers user sessions in
 the systemd control group hierarchy.

Description: nss module providing fallback resolution for the current hostname
 This package contains a plugin for the Name Service Switch, providing host
 name resolution for the locally configured system hostname as returned by
 gethostname(2). It returns all locally configured public IP addresses or -- if
 none are configured, the IPv4 address 127.0.1.1 (which is on the local
 loopback) and the IPv6 address ::1 (which is the local host).
 .
 A lot of software relies on that the local host name is resolvable. This
 package provides an alternative to the fragile and error-prone manual editing
 of /etc/hosts.
 .
 Installing this package automatically adds myhostname to /etc/nsswitch.conf.

Description: nss module to resolve hostnames for local container instances
 nss-mymachines is a plugin for the GNU Name Service Switch (NSS) functionality
 of the GNU C Library (glibc) providing hostname resolution for local containers
 that are registered with systemd-machined.service(8). The container names are
 resolved to IP addresses of the specific container, ordered by their scope.
 .
 Installing this package automatically adds mymachines to /etc/nsswitch.conf.
