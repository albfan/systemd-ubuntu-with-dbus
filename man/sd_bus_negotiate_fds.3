.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsd_bus_negotiate_fds()\fR
controls whether file descriptor passing shall be negotiated for the specified bus connection\&. It takes a bus object and a boolean, which, when true, enables file descriptor passing, and, when false, disables it\&. Note that not all transports and servers support file descriptor passing\&. To find out whether file descriptor passing is available after negotiation, use
\fBsd_bus_can_send\fR(3)
and pass
\fBSD_BUS_TYPE_UNIX_FD\fR\&. Note that file descriptor passing is always enabled for both sending and receiving or for neither, but never only in one direction\&. By default, file descriptor passing is negotiated for all connections\&.
.PP
Note that when bus activation is used, it is highly recommended to set the
\fBAcceptFileDescriptors=\fR
setting in the
\&.busname
unit file to the same setting as negotiated by the program ultimately activated\&. By default, file descriptor passing is enabled for both\&.
.PP
\fBsd_bus_negotiate_timestamps()\fR
controls whether implicit sender timestamps shall be attached automatically to all incoming messages\&. Takes a bus object and a boolean, which, when true, enables timestamping, and, when false, disables it\&. If this is disabled,
\fBsd_bus_message_get_monotonic_usec\fR(3),
\fBsd_bus_message_get_realtime_usec\fR(3),
\fBsd_bus_message_get_seqnum\fR(3)
fail with
\fB\-ENODATA\fR
on incoming messages\&. Note that not all transports support timestamping of messages\&. On local transports, the timestamping is applied by the kernel and cannot be manipulated by userspace\&. By default, message timestamping is not negotiated for all connections\&.
.PP
\fBsd_bus_negotiate_creds()\fR
controls whether implicit sender credentials shall be attached automatically to all incoming messages\&. Takes a bus object, a boolean indicating whether to enable or disable the credential parts encoded in the bit mask value argument\&. Note that not all transports support attaching sender credentials to messages, or do not support all types of sender credential parameters, or might suppress them under certain circumstances for individual messages\&. On local transports, the sender credentials are attached by the kernel and cannot be manipulated by userspace\&. By default, no sender credentials are attached\&.
.PP
The
\fBsd_bus_negotiate_fds()\fR
function may be called only before the connection has been started with
\fBsd_bus_start\fR(3)\&. Both
\fBsd_bus_negotiate_timestamp()\fR
and
\fBsd_bus_negotiate_creds()\fR
also may be called after a connection has been set up\&. Note that when operating on a connection that is shared between multiple components of the same program (for example via
\fBsd_bus_default\fR(3)) it is highly recommended to only enable additional per message metadata fields, but never disable them again, in order not to disable functionality needed by other components\&.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
On success, these functions returns 0 or a positive integer\&. On failure, they return a negative errno\-style error code\&.
.SH "ERRORS"
.PP
Returned errors may indicate the following problems:
.PP
\fB\-EPERM\fR
.RS 4
The bus connection has already been started\&.
.RE
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
\fBsd_bus_negotiate_fs()\fR
and the other functions described here are available as a shared library, which can be compiled and linked to with the
\fBlibsystemd\fR\ \&\fBpkg-config\fR(1)
file\&.
