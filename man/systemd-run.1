.SH "NAME"
systemd-run \- Run programs in transient scope or service or timer units
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBsystemd\-run\fR\ 'u
\fBsystemd\-run\fR [OPTIONS...] \fICOMMAND\fR\ [ARGS...] 
.HP \w'\fBsystemd\-run\fR\ 'u
\fBsystemd\-run\fR [OPTIONS...] [TIMER\ OPTIONS...] {\fICOMMAND\fR} [ARGS...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsystemd\-run\fR
may be used to create and start a transient
\&.service
or a transient
\&.timer
or a
\&.scope
unit and run the specified
\fICOMMAND\fR
in it\&.
.PP
If a command is run as transient service unit, it will be started and managed by the service manager like any other service, and thus show up in the output of
\fBsystemctl list\-units\fR
like any other unit\&. It will run in a clean and detached execution environment\&.
\fBsystemd\-run\fR
will start the service asynchronously in the background and immediately return\&.
.PP
If a command is run with timer options, transient timer unit also be created with transient service unit\&. But the transient timer unit is only started immediately\&. The transient service unit will be started when the transient timer is elapsed\&. If
\fB\-\-unit=\fR
is specified with timer options, the
\fICOMMAND\fR
can be omitted\&. In this case,
\fBsystemd\-run\fR
assumes service unit is already loaded and creates transient timer unit only\&. To successfully create timer unit, already loaded service unit should be specified with
\fB\-\-unit=\fR\&. This transient timer unit can activate the existing service unit like any other timer\&.
.PP
If a command is run as transient scope unit, it will be started directly by
\fBsystemd\-run\fR
and thus inherit the execution environment of the caller\&. It is however managed by the service manager similar to normal services, and will also show up in the output of
\fBsystemctl list\-units\fR\&. Execution in this case is synchronous, and execution will return only when the command finishes\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options are understood:
.PP
\fB\-\-scope\fR
.RS 4
Create a transient
\&.scope
unit instead of the default transient
\&.service
unit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-unit=\fR
.RS 4
Use this unit name instead of an automatically generated one\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-property=\fR, \fB\-p\fR
.RS 4
Sets a unit property for the scope or service unit that is created\&. This takes an assignment in the same format as
\fBsystemctl\fR(1)\*(Aqs
\fBset\-property\fR
command\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-description=\fR
.RS 4
Provide a description for the service or scope unit\&. If not specified, the command itself will be used as a description\&. See
\fIDescription=\fR
in
\fBsystemd.unit\fR(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-slice=\fR
.RS 4
Make the new
\&.service
or
\&.scope
unit part of the specified slice, instead of the
system\&.slice\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-remain\-after\-exit\fR
.RS 4
After the service or scope process has terminated, keep the service around until it is explicitly stopped\&. This is useful to collect runtime information about the service after it finished running\&. Also see
\fIRemainAfterExit=\fR
in
\fBsystemd.service\fR(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-send\-sighup\fR
.RS 4
When terminating the scope or service unit, send a SIGHUP immediately after SIGTERM\&. This is useful to indicate to shells and shell\-like processes that the connection has been severed\&. Also see
\fISendSIGHUP=\fR
in
\fBsystemd.kill\fR(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-service\-type=\fR
.RS 4
Sets the service type\&. Also see
\fIType=\fR
in
\fBsystemd.service\fR(5)\&. This option has no effect in conjunction with
\fB\-\-scope\fR\&. Defaults to
\fBsimple\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-uid=\fR, \fB\-\-gid=\fR
.RS 4
Runs the service process under the UNIX user and group\&. Also see
\fIUser=\fR
and
\fIGroup=\fR
in
\fBsystemd.exec\fR(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-nice=\fR
.RS 4
Runs the service process with the specified nice level\&. Also see
\fINice=\fR
in
\fBsystemd.exec\fR(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-setenv=\fR
.RS 4
Runs the service process with the specified environment variables set\&. Also see
\fIEnvironment=\fR
in
\fBsystemd.exec\fR(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-pty\fR, \fB\-t\fR
.RS 4
When invoking a command as service connects its standard input and output to the invoking tty via a pseudo TTY device\&. This allows invoking binaries as services that expect interactive user input, such as interactive command shells\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR, \fB\-q\fR
.RS 4
Suppresses additional informational output while running\&. This is particularly useful in combination with
\fB\-\-pty\fR
when it will suppress the initial message explaining how to terminate the TTY connection\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-on\-active=\fR, \fB\-\-on\-boot=\fR, \fB\-\-on\-startup=\fR, \fB\-\-on\-unit\-active=\fR, \fB\-\-on\-unit\-inactive=\fR
.RS 4
Defines monotonic timers relative to different starting points\&. Also see
\fIOnActiveSec=\fR,
\fIOnBootSec=\fR,
\fIOnStartupSec=\fR,
\fIOnUnitActiveSec=\fR
and
\fIOnUnitInactiveSec=\fR
in
\fBsystemd.timer\fR(5)\&. This options have no effect in conjunction with
\fB\-\-scope\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-on\-calendar=\fR
.RS 4
Defines realtime (i\&.e\&. wallclock) timers with calendar event expressions\&. Also see
\fIOnCalendar=\fR
in
\fBsystemd.timer\fR(5)\&. This option has no effect in conjunction with
\fB\-\-scope\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-timer\-property=\fR
.RS 4
Sets a timer unit property for the timer unit that is created\&. It is similar with
\fB\-\-property\fR
but only for created timer unit\&. This option only has effect in conjunction with
\fB\-\-on\-active=\fR,
\fB\-\-on\-boot=\fR,
\fB\-\-on\-startup=\fR,
\fB\-\-on\-unit\-active=\fR,
\fB\-\-on\-unit\-inactive=\fR,
\fB\-\-on\-calendar=\fR\&. This takes an assignment in the same format as
\fBsystemctl\fR(1)\*(Aqs
\fBset\-property\fR
command\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-block\fR
.RS 4
Do not synchronously wait for the requested operation to finish\&. If this is not specified, the job will be verified, enqueued and
\fBsystemd\-run\fR
will wait until the unit\*(Aqs start\-up is completed\&. By passing this argument, it is only verified and enqueued\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-user\fR
.RS 4
Talk to the service manager of the calling user, rather than the service manager of the system\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-system\fR
.RS 4
Talk to the service manager of the system\&. This is the implied default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-host=\fR
.RS 4
Execute the operation remotely\&. Specify a hostname, or a username and hostname separated by
"@", to connect to\&. The hostname may optionally be suffixed by a container name, separated by
":", which connects directly to a specific container on the specified host\&. This will use SSH to talk to the remote machine manager instance\&. Container names may be enumerated with
\fBmachinectl \-H \fR\fB\fIHOST\fR\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-machine=\fR
.RS 4
Execute operation on a local container\&. Specify a container name to connect to\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Print a short help text and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Print a short version string and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
All command line arguments after the first non\-option argument become part of the command line of the launched process\&. If a command is run as service unit, its first argument needs to be an absolute binary path\&.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.PP
On success, 0 is returned, a non\-zero failure code otherwise\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
